  <h2>Klocwork Servers</h2>
  <p>
      Provide Klocwork servers that you want to connect with.
      The name is used as an identifier and is referenced on a job config under
      Build Environment. The URL should be in the form:
      http://kwserver:8080
  </p>
  <h3>Specific License Settings</h3>
  <p>
      Typically organisations can have multiple Klocwork servers but a single
      FlexLM license server. In this case, provide the license settings under
      the Global License Settings
  </p>
  <p>
      If you use different license servers, then provide the specific license
      settings that you want to use depending on which Klocwork server URL
      you are using. Simply tick the "Use specific License Settings for this
      Klocwork Server" checkbox and provide the license host and port
  </p>
